			I knew you by your name when you registered for the workshop. That was the time when I got your number(Not an easy task for me to get the number of a girl lol).
What I didnt know was that you were quite famous person in the campus.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>One day by mistake or I dont know (purposely) you send me some videos of your friends having fun. I was damned at that moment didnt know what was that. You asked me to delete those to which I replied that you people dance well (LOL I remember what I replied) then my friend talked to you and apparently you yelled at him (he was shocked ) and I snatched  the phone from him and asked for forgiveness.
				*Titled earned - Batmeez ;)</em>

			<strong>PS- I deleted that videos when you told. I was just playing with you. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			And then I came to know that you were in my class. I was like FUCK there goes my reputation cause I have already messed up. 
		</p>
		<p>
HUH... then time passed and we enjoyed our own life. I was high and bored most of the times so I dont remember much.

Then finally came the month of feb when we planned for the epic trip to george. 
I seriously didnt know that you or any other girl would be interested in planning a trip with people like us. BUT IT HAPPENED.
